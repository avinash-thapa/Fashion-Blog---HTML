This project is part of the course: Beginner HTML in CodeAcademy

# Introduction
Project Description (Source: [CodeAcademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html))

"Your friend Isa is a budding fashion blogger, and she’s asked you to build her a new website, just in time for New York Fashion Week! 

Use your new HTML knowledge to create the underlying structure of the blog. Make sure to include plenty of pictures, links, lists, and other HTML elements that you’ve learned so that her fans have plenty to read."

# Goals
I will utilize my HTML knowledge to develop a blog post utilizing tools such as headings, divs, styling, underordered list, images, and linking to other web pages.

This will be an initial project to launch a self-made portfolio website.
